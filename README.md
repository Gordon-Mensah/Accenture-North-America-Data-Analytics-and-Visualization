Good afternoon, everyone! I’m John Jerry Gordon-Mensah, and I’m excited to share some key insights with you today. Thank you for the questions you provided; they were incredibly helpful in guiding the analysis and ensuring I focused on what’s most relevant for your strategic decisions.

Before we get into the main findings, I want to touch briefly on the data cleaning process. When I brought the data into Power BI, I noticed a few issues—such as negative quantities and some incorrect unit prices. These seemed to be from product returns and data entry errors, so I filtered out any quantities below 1 and unit prices below $0. This gave us a much more reliable dataset to work with.

Starting with the first question: the CEO wanted to look at revenue trends throughout the year to see if there’s any seasonality in sales. In the first eight months, revenue stays pretty steady, averaging about $685,000 each month. But starting in September, we see a significant increase—revenue goes up by about 40%, continuing to grow until November, when it peaks at around $1.5 million. Unfortunately, December’s data is incomplete, but this pattern suggests a seasonal boost in the last quarter, likely from holiday sales. Knowing this can help us plan for the next year with targeted marketing and stocking strategies for these busy months.

For the second question, the CMO was interested in seeing the top 10 countries driving revenue, excluding the UK. Here’s what we found: countries like the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France are generating strong sales. These markets are clear opportunities for growth, so by focusing on them, we could maximize revenue in regions with proven demand.

Moving to the third question, which is about our top 10 customers by revenue. This analysis helps us understand our high-value customer base. We found that revenue is fairly balanced across the top 10, with the top customer only generating about 17% more revenue than the second. This shows we’re not overly dependent on any one customer, which is a good position to be in. It also suggests that our customer base has solid purchasing power. Moving forward, it might be worth considering loyalty programs or targeted outreach to keep these high-value customers engaged and coming back.

Lastly, the CEO wanted a global view of where demand is highest, excluding the UK. The map shows that outside of the UK, countries like the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, and Australia are leading in revenue. Most of our sales are concentrated in Europe, with less presence in North America, Asia, or Africa. This could be a significant growth opportunity. Expanding into these untapped regions could diversify our customer base and build new revenue streams.

To wrap up, here are my main recommendations: (1) Make the most of seasonal demand: Targeted campaigns and stock planning for the last quarter could maximize revenue during this high-demand period. (2) Prioritize high-demand countries: Focusing on the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, and France could drive substantial growth. (3) Strengthen relationships with top customers: Programs that keep these high-value customers engaged could benefit our overall revenue. (4) Consider expansion into untapped regions: Exploring North America and Asia could open new avenues for growth.

Thank you all for your time and attention. I’m happy to answer any questions or dive deeper into any area. I look forward to discussing how we can use these insights to shape future growth.
